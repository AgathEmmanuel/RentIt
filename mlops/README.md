# ML platform  


- Rental recommendations using CloudSQL and spark  
- deploy ml model with spark connecting to data warehouse  
- build an sclable ML pipeline for the model  


- Data ingestion and featurization  (Spark, Kafka, etc..)  
- Training  (Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc)  
- Serving  

- How fast can we update the model  



# Agenda  

- Business applications  




# ML Ops Overview    

MLOps is concerned with deploying the ML system and the continous evoulution of the models  

MLOps principles include   

-    Framing ML problems from business objectives  
-    Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
-    Architect ML and data solutions for the problem  
-    Data Prep and Feature Engineering  
-    Model training and experimentation â€” data science  
-    Model training and tuning  
-    Building and automating ML pipelines  
-    Deploying models to the production system  
-    Model review and governance  
-    Model inference and serving  
-    Model monitoring, optimizing and maintainance  
-    Automated model retraining  
-    Explainability and interpretability  


Machine Learning frameworks such as Keras, PyTorch, Tensorflow  
Popular MLOps frameworks like Kubeflow, MLFlow, and DataRobot  
Continuous model monitoring and maintenance with focus on:  
Feedback loop  
Data Drift  
Seasonality  


This MLOps setup includes the following components:

-    Source control  
-    Test and build services  
-    Deployment services  
-    Model registry  
-    Feature store  
-    ML metadata store  
-    ML pipeline orchestrator.
