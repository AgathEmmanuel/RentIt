# ML platform  


- Rental recommendations using CloudSQL and spark  
- deploy ml model with spark connecting to data warehouse  
- build an sclable ML pipeline for the model  


- Data ingestion and featurization  (Spark, Kafka, etc..)  
- Training  (Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc)  
- Serving  

- How fast can we update the model  



## Business Requirements

- Recommendation of rentals based on preferences  

## Recommendation starategies  
- predict the rating the given user will give for a given rental product  
- make use of existing user ratings  
- similar minded users will have similar taste  
- actually how good is the product  
- how frequent should the predictive rating be calculated  
- stream processing can be used if rental recommendation have to updated in real time  
- batch processing can be used if rental recommendation have to updated only once per day  
- the predictive rating should be computed using a hadoop cluster  
- the predicted ratings will be stored in cloudSQL  
- sparkML can be used to run the ML job on DataProc  
- sparkML = feature prep + model training  
- save results of feature prep job in TF compatible format  
- create a TF job for training  
- create kubefow or argoflow pipeline to train the model  






# steps  
- Experimentation/Development  
- Training pipeline CI/CD  
- Continous Training  
- Model Serving CI/CD  
- Serving and Monitoring  



# ML Ops Overview    

MLOps is concerned with deploying the ML system and the continous evoulution of the models  

MLOps principles include   

-    Framing ML problems from business objectives  
-    Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
-    Architect ML and data solutions for the problem  
-    Data Prep and Feature Engineering  
-    Model training and experimentation â€” data science  
-    Model training and tuning  
-    Building and automating ML pipelines  
-    Deploying models to the production system  
-    Model review and governance  
-    Model inference and serving  
-    Model monitoring, optimizing and maintainance  
-    Automated model retraining  
-    Explainability and interpretability  


Machine Learning frameworks such as Keras, PyTorch, Tensorflow  
Popular MLOps frameworks like Kubeflow, MLFlow, and DataRobot  
Continuous model monitoring and maintenance with focus on:  
Feedback loop  
Data Drift  
Seasonality  


This MLOps setup includes the following components:

-    Source control  
-    Test and build services  
-    Deployment services  
-    Model registry  
-    Feature store  
-    ML metadata store  
-    ML pipeline orchestrator.
